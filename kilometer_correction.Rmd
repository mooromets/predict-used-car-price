## Data overview
```{r , echo=FALSE}
ggplot(autoData(), aes(yearOfRegistration, kilometer))+
  geom_count() +
  scale_size_area() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Trend line seems unlikely, as it seems there's no correlation that the older autos have more kilometers.  
The number of cars with less or one year old and more than 70000 km is abnormal.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(autoData()[autoData()$yearOfRegistration > 2009,], 
       aes(yearOfRegistration, kilometer)) +
  geom_count() +
  scale_size_area()
```

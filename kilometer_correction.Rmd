```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r source files, echo=FALSE}
source("./R/ML_utils.R")
source("./R/data-clean.R")
```

## Trendline at first place looks like this
```{r , echo=FALSE}
qplot(autoData()$yearOfRegistration, autoData()$kilometer) + geom_smooth()
```

That seems unlikely, as it seems there's no correlation that the older autos have more kilometers.  

The number of cars with less or one year old and more than 100000 km is abnormal.
```{r}
(table(autoData()[autoData()$yearOfRegistration > 2010,]$kilometer, autoData()[autoData()$yearOfRegistration > 2010,]$yearOfRegistration))
```
